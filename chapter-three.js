// JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: Primitive and Object types.
// Primitive types include numbers, strings, boolean values, null and undefined.
// Anything else is an object
// An array is an object, as well as Set, Map, RegExp, Date, Error, functions and classes
// Object types are mutable (changable) Primitive types are immutable.
// JavaScript will convert values from one type to another.
