// JavaScript types can be divided into two categories: Primitive and Object types.
// Primitive types include numbers, strings, boolean values, null and undefined.
// Anything else is an object
// An array is an object, as well as Set, Map, RegExp, Date, Error, functions and classes
// Object types are mutable (changable) Primitive types are immutable.
// JavaScript will convert values from one type to another. 
// When a number appears in JavaScript it is a numeric literal
// Base 10, hex (beginning with an Ox) base 2 (Ob) or base 8 (Oo)
